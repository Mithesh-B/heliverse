# Team Up
Team up is a web application that displays data as cards with various filters and features to help users easily find and add unique cards to their team or cart. The application has a responsive design that makes it suitable for different screen sizes, a working search bar to help users quickly find the cards they are looking for, and filters that allow users to narrow down the displayed cards based on their availability, gender, and domain. https://heliverse1.netlify.app/
